    "The data that was required to be wrangled for this project related to the WeRateDogs Twitter page. Various pet owners post images of their dog with a caption and light-hearted rating system. Other Twitter users then like and retweet the original tweet posts. Additionally, a separate model was built to predict the breeds of dogs found in the images posted on twitter. In order to discover any potential relationships between ratings, likes, retweets and dog breeds, 3 different data sources needed to be gathered, assessed and cleaned.\n",
